Indecision is a very fun app that can be used to help make decisions. &nbsp; Once deployed, it gives the option to enter in several choices and lets the app pick for you.     

### Getting Started 

To get things moving, copy the file using Clone/download in github.&nbsp; In your bash window do a git clone and paste the copied link to the repo.


### Installing: Once it is cloned to the local machine, open in a text editor.
 

    yarn install



### Running the program

    yarn run dev-server
